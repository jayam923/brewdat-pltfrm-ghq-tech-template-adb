# BrewDat ADB Library

In ESA, we intend to provide data engineers with a library that they can leverage to accelerate the development process -- extracting data to the Raw Layer, ingesting it into the Bronze Layer, ingesting it into the Silver Layer, and finally creating Gold data products based on that data, all while using best practices for auditing, exception handling, dependency control, Data Lake organization, etc. 

You can find mode information about available functionality in the code for module `brewdat.data_engineering`, or under `docs/library_docs/`.

Regarding the development lifecycle for this project, you can find more information under `docs/release_workflow/`.

This project is maintained in the the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/BrewDat/brewdat-pltfrm-ghq-tech-template-adb](https://github.com/BrewDat/brewdat-pltfrm-ghq-tech-template-adb).
