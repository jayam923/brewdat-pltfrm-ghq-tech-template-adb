# BrewDat ADB Library

In ESA, we intend to provide data engineers with a library
that they can leverage to accelerate the development process 
-- extracting data to the Raw Layer, ingesting it into the Bronze Layer,
ingesting it into the Silver Layer, and finally creating Gold data 
products based on that data, all while using best practices for 
auditing, exception handling, dependency control, Data Lake organization,
etc. 

You can find mode information about the functionalities that are currently 
available on BrewDat library for Databricks Notebooks looking directly 
on module `brewdat.data_engineering` code or [here](./docs/library_doc.md).

Regarding the development lifecycle of this project, you can find more information
[here](./docs/framework_release_workflow.md).
